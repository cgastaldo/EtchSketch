# EtchSketch

Project Odin Foundations Etch-a-Sketch.

Minimized amount of CSS used and pushed majority through js file. Could eliminate CSS file but completed goal and don't see point.

Project took a while - stuck on elimination of current grid to replace with new grid. The divs were apart of an array and could not be deleted individually.
